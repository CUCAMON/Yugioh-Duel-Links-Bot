4) Start the game and go to the Gate location
5) Start the bot, set the number of clicks per panel (default = 5), and click the "Start" button

Notes:

*When you click "Start", the "Quit" button will turn red. This means user input is disabled and **you won't be able to move the cursor or use your keyboard.** However, when the Auto-Duel button is pressed in game, the "Quit" button will turn green, meaning you are free to use the cursor.*

*Keep the Nox window on your main monitor, if you have multiple monitors this will be Monitor 1.* 

*Do not cover the Nox window with any other windows, or it will get in the way of the bot. Keep it on top.*

*If you want to stop the bot manually while input is disabled, press Ctrl+Alt+Del to regain access to your mouse and keyboard. You can then proceed to quit the program.*
